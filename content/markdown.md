# Markdown = Simpler HTML

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) created by the John Gruber, is simple text which is friendly to the eye and with an added benefit, it converts to HTML. Although not by itself, you need a program to convert it. But it is very easy to implement, read on. Many modern blogging services, forums related to programming, and Wikipedia itself, use markdown. Because its easy and plain.

Here's an example:
```python
# This is first heading

Some paragraph text

## This is H2 tag
### H3, the first was H1
#### h4 and so on

    some code (indent the code);

```

Which gives:

># This is first heading
>Some paragraph text
>## This is H2 tag
>### H3, the first was H1
>#### h4 and so on
>```some code (indent the code);```

------

## Setup
