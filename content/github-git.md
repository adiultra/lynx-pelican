This article is for those who know how to code and are new to github, and git in overall. This article provides a subtle intro for git and its hosting service Github.

## `git` - The project management tool

Git is a command line tool for source code management. That is, it manages your code. It makes a history of changes for you to browse, and helps maintain it using Branches.

[Here's](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) how to set up git.

According to git's official documentation git is [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).

The greatest way to learn git is to use it. But for some reason you may not want to dive deep right now. [Visit](https://try.github.io/) github's Code School for learning git. It allows you to experiment with git and increase your confidence.

## Github

After visiting sites about git you can move on to Github. It is a remote hosting service for your git repositories. (You may be unable to understand from now on if you didn't visit any links above).

Github's own [Intro](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) suffices its intro.

Another [Intro](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/) for Github.

One [Intro](http://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-to-GitHub/) is also available on Instructables.


### Tools to use

- [Ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit) - easy to use git client.
- [gitg](https://github.com/jessevdk/gitg) - Git repo management app.

After Using github your coding will become like this:
